        <div class="subheading mb-5">History Major</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4"> I am David Robles, and I plan on majoring in history. During high school, that has always been a goal of mine, and a main topic of interest that I have always had during school. For a couple years of middle school, I took many history based classes, which helped me learn more in the eyes of a historian, and how to do more studies regarding that subject. I went to Heritage High School in Menifee, CA for all four years, and graduated there with a 3.95 GPA. All four years I had a history class of some kind and passed all of them with an A. Regardless of grade however, the class was always interesting, and I put my full attention into every detail. Besides history, I consider myself a good student, since I love school to an extent (Math is not my favorite.)   <br><br>

        Since this is my first year in CHASS, I have not had many opportunities in participating in any professional internships or simple activities in relation to history. I do however plan on doing so in my coming years of my attendance at UCR and CHASS. If I am given any research opportunities then I will be sure to look at them and ponder on accepting them for the benefit of my major. I have done some history research papers in the past, specifically during high school. These papers gave me an insight on what I would need to be able to excell in history, and study as a historian in the future. My favorite topic within the subject of history would be pre-renaissance Europe. That has always been an interest as well, and I do have alot of experience in that subject simply by researching and learning a little bit during my public school years. I can definitely say that I am not a professional in this field, however it is the topic in which I do plan on being more involved in, and become an expert in. My work ethic is something I am proud of, and if I put my dedication and hard work together, I know I can succeed in the places that I plan to, and the places that I want to.<br><br>

        My professional experience outside of the subject of history would lie mainly under retail and office experience. My current job is a Kohls retail associate. This profession gives me the proper training for people skills and allows me to take full responsibility of an entire department of the store. This job also gives me accountability and forces me to be organized and attentive to my work. Besides organizational skills that this job requires and provides, it helps me love working, and to love learning even more. 
        Like I said, I have both retail and office experience. During high school I participated in community service at the Riverside CHP offices, where I mainly sorted alot of important documents. This job also gave me responsibility and accountability along with introducing me in an office environment and how to work under those conditions.
